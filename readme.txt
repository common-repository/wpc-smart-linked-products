== Description ==

Promoting related products, upsells or cross-sells are among the most effective and common ways to encourage buyers to find out more choices and close the deal with a higher amount than their original intentions.

Worth mentioning is, this plugin is so versatile and powerful that users can define the sources for the main product & applicable linked products in abundant ways: storewide products, selected items, product types, tags, categories, attributes, etc. Users can also limit the number of linked products and order them to show the priority choice.

= Distinguish between Related Products, Upsells & Cross-sells =

Related products are displayed on the single product page where, in most cases, written “Related products” to promote products that share the same tags or categories with the main item that is being viewed.

Upsells are products that come in a higher, better version than the one being viewed. Upsells are often considered the “upgraded” version of the current one with better quality and a higher price. When placed together, customers might end up comparing and choosing to buy a more expensive item.

Cross-sells are complementary products that are often bought with or can go well with the main item. Customers can choose to purchase a combo of items to enjoy the discount or get better suggestions of what will come in handy when they purchase more items. Cross-sell products are displayed on the mini-cart and cart page to remind buyers of what they might have forgotten to get.

If you use the WPC Custom Related Products plugin, you can find the Related products tab on the single product page to customize the item list. Linked products can be found on the Linked products tab. The global rules can be configured from under the WPClever menu.

= Which to use? =

When you need to automatically create related products from items that share the same tags or categories or define a hand-picked list of choices, you can use the WPC Custom Related Products plugin.

When you need to take it to a higher level by suggesting more discounts when people purchase the related products alongside the main one, you can use the WPC Frequently Bought Together plugin and make related products the default products for Bought Together deal.

When you need to create a custom list of up-sells or cross-sells and attach to different products at the same time in bulk, you can use this WPC Smart Linked Products plugin to deal with that.
